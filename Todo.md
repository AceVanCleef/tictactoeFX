# TODOs

- Notify all Players (@GUI) how the game has ended (Player 1 wins, Player 2 wins, The game ended in a draw)
  
  Idea: change background color accordingly: player 1 wins -> BGColor of Player01's section changes. Draw? Bgcolor of center section changes.
- change ScoreView - simple control from HBox to a TableView
